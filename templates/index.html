        <p>Hello, welcome to my webpage for top-cat and top-dog. I don't proffit off this at all. All the content you'll see is taken directly from /r/aww. I don't own any of the pictures/videos, credit goes to the original posters, etc.</p>
        <p>To learn how I implemented top cat and top dog, please check out my <a href="https://github.com/simnim/top-cat">github</a> page for the project details. I'm currently only showing 10 pictures/videos at a time for top cat and top dog. Check back in every few days for fresh top cats and dogs.</p>
        <p>My main profession is bioinformatics. This was my COVID19 <strike><i>lockdown</i></strike> vacation hobby project. I wanted to learn more about state of the art in computer vision tooling and how to properly share that awesomeness with the world. Had a fruitful and interesting time learning about opencv, tensorflow research models, flask, aiosql, etc.</p>
